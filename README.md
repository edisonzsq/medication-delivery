## Introduction

This is my individual project for the SkillsUnion/NTU Software Developer Immersive course. I created a medication delivery order system. I created my own db.json file and API data using jsonplaceholder.typicode.com.

## Built with

* React
* Axios
* API
* Visual Studios Code

## Usage

Type the name, dosage and frequency of your medication in the input box.

## Improvement

Moving forward, I will convert the input box to a drop-down list that fetches data from an API. I will also require the user to perform user authentication prior to accessing his/her prescription.
